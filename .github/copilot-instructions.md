This is a Godot 4.4 GDScript template project for rapid game development and prototyping.

When working with GDScript code, always use snake_case for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes and enums, and SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants.

Use @onready for node references that need to be accessed in _ready(), and always use explicit typing when beneficial like `var player: Player`.

Place scene files (.tscn) in the /scenes/ directory and script files (.gd) in the /scripts/ directory.

Use the VS Code task "Run Godot Project" to open the Godot editor for scene creation, and "Run Game" for quick testing without the editor.

This project follows official Godot documentation conventions and best practices for code organization and structure.

The current ball example is template content meant to be replaced with actual game functionality.
